I am Simon Mahler, a postdoctoral scholar research associate at California Institute of Technology, in the 
[Biophotonics Lab](https://biophot.caltech.edu/) of Professor Changhuei Yang. Before that, I was a PhD student at Weizmann Institute of Science, in the [Coupled Lasers Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/NirDavidson/research-activities/coupled-lasers) of Professors Nir Davidson and Asher A. Friesem.

My research concentrates on the intersection of bio-imaging and optics, with focus on how light interacts with biological samples (biophotonics) and interests in engineering, device design, the integration of artificial intelligence, the development of novel light sources, and translational research. My goal is to develop innovative imaging techniques to visualize dynamic biological processes, such as blood dynamics with applications ranging from neurological diseases to embryonic development. For that, I am using laser speckle imaging. 

 If you’re interested in further details of any of my work or just want to connect, feel free to contact me!
